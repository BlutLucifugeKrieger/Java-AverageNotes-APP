# Java-AverageNotes-APP

As u can see, this file .rar is the same to "Java-Encripter-APP", but the difference is the method that was call in the main class,
it's means thats u can uncomment the others methods and probe one by one the functionabilty of them, in this case, i settled the averageNotes method.
